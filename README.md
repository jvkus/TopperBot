# TopperBot
Personal project, runs on Python, uses Discord API, Google OCR, Google Sheets API. Currently rewriting.


## Project Origins
The original intent of this project was to create a Discord bot that allowed users to update my "database"
(which, at the time, was a massive and ugly Google Sheets file) of their game inventories by sending the bot
screenshots. Users would then be able to query the database to see which users had which items, and what
items which users had. The game also has a variety of color palettes, and because not everyone owns every
color palette, another in-progress feature was to allow a user to query the bot on Discord with a hex code
and the palettes they owned to find x closest colors. This was for a very niche purpose as part of logistics
for videos shot within the game *Warframe*. The video director needed very specific loadouts for certain
videos at times, and this was started to make the process of finding people with the right items much easier.
This was started back in late 2017 and progress stopped to focus on schoolwork. All old code is now located
in old/, and all keys and secrets have been obfuscated for security reasons; because no valid keys have been
left in the old files, some old code may not work correctly.
In 2019, I've decided to revisit and rewrite this project for fun and will be updating it as I make progress
on it.
